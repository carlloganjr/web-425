        American science fiction novelist Frank Herbert was best known for the
        epic "Dune" series. Herbert was born in Tacoma, Washington and tried
        journalism and photography before switching to science fiction writing.
        In 1965 Herbert's Dune was published. It depicted human-kind spread across
        the galaxy in the future with the plot centering on the spice planet "Dune."
        Herbert was renowned for his detailed characters, beautifully created
        settings, and study of subjects including politics, ecology, and
        spirituality. For his work, he won a great deal of recognition, including
        five Hugo Awards, one Nebula Award, and the Gandalf Grand Master Award.
